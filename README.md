# Salesforce XML Beautifier

This extension formats Salesforce XML files more meaningfully to improve readability and minimize changes.

This extension is powered by the [xml2js](https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js) library with some customizations to implement file-specific indentation requirements, special characters escaping, and a newline character at the end of the XML file.
